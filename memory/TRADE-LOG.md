# Trade Log

Trades and end-of-day snapshots are appended here.

In v1, only EOD snapshots are written (by the `daily-summary` routine). Trade rows are added in v2 by `market-open` and `midday`.

## Entry Schemas

### Trade row (v2)
```
### YYYY-MM-DD — TRADE: TICKER side=buy|sell qty=N
- Entry: $X (or Exit: $X)
- Stop level: $X (trailing N% / fixed $X)
- Thesis: ...

- Target: $X (R:R X:1)
- Realized P&L (on exits only): $X
```

### EOD snapshot (v1)
```

## Day 0 — EOD Snapshot (pre-launch baseline)
**Portfolio:** $10,000.00 | **Cash:** $10,000.00 (100%) | **Day P&L:** $0.00 (0.00%) | **Phase P&L:** $0.00 (0.00%)

No positions yet. v1 launches on the next weekday's `pre-market` routine. The `daily-summary` routine will reconcile this baseline against the actual paper-account equity on Day 1.
