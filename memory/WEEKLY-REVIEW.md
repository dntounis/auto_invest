| ------ | ---------- | ------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| XLE    | $57.290588 | $59.41  | +$72.03 (+3.70%) | $53.45 (trail 10%)  |
| XLI    | $173.713636| $171.39 | -$25.56 (-1.34%) | $157.25 (trail 10%) |
| XLP    | $84.274348 | $84.66  | +$8.87 (+0.46%)  | $77.02 (trail 10%)  |

### What Worked
- **Patience > activity paid off.** Held flat at $10K for the entirety of v1 (Apr 27 → May 11) and the first two days of v2 (May 12 stale-quote XLI limit expired unfilled). Re-entered May 13 post-PPI with live quotes and clean fills inside ~40s — no slippage drag from chasing.
- **Buy-Side Gate held cleanly at submit.** All three May 13 BUYs passed every gate (positions ≤6, weekly trades ≤3, position cost ≤20% equity, cost ≤cash, daytrade_count buffer, catalyst documented). Cost-basis sizing landed 19.11–19.48% of equity per leg — tight under the 20% Rule 3 cap.
- **Sector-rotation conviction.** XLE/XLI/XLP were all in the leading quadrant per the Investing.com sector-rotation read; XLE +3.70% on the week validates the post-Hormuz-closure energy thesis.
- **Rule 13 worked as designed.** All three trailing stops placed at daily-summary T 15:00 CT — none could fire same-day, zero day-trade exposure. daytrade_count stayed 0/5 all week.
- **Beat the S&P benchmark.** Bot +0.55% vs SPX ~+0.09% (≈+0.46% alpha) — small base, only 2 sessions held, but directionally correct.

### What Didn't Work
- **Cap deployment 58% vs 75–85% v2 target.** Hit Rule 4 weekly cap (3/3) before reaching target deployment. Two unheld leading-quadrant sectors (XLB, XLU) carried to next Monday with no exposure this week.
- **May 12 XLE/XLP skipped on stale quotes (ap=0).** Lost a one-day head start on the energy/staples thesis. Re-entered May 13 at slightly higher prices (XLE $57.29 vs ~$56 May 12 bid; XLP $84.27 vs ~$82 May 12 bid). Cost: ~1–2% of position size in entry slippage relative to the missed May 12 fill.
- **XLI weakest leg.** Flat-to-down all week (close $171.39 vs entry $173.71, -1.34%). Industrials thesis (capex/AI-infra/grid/reshoring + Hormuz defense kicker) hasn't been confirmed by tape; watching for sector-rotation degrade next week.
- **Documentation gap May 8 / May 11 (no EOD snapshots).** Three-day cadence break before v2 deployment resumed. Doesn't affect P&L (no fills) but breaks the audit trail for prior-week starting-portfolio reconciliation; relied on carry-forward $10K for week-start.

### Key Lessons
- **Stale quotes (ap=0) on illiquid pre-market windows kill execution.** STEP 5a abort is correct (don't size off bid-only) but cost a day of exposure. Consider a STEP 5a fallback: if ap=0 but bid exists and spread is reasonable on the prior session's close, defer to next session's market-open rather than skip entirely. Open question for v3.
- **Weekly cap (Rule 4) binds before deployment-target (Rule 5).** With 5 candidate sectors and a 3-trade/week cap, full 75–85% deployment requires at least 2 weeks. Acceptable in v2 (slow, conservative ramp); flag for v3 as a structural constraint, not a bug.
- **Rule 13 close-time stop placement is operationally robust.** Zero same-day exit risk, daytrade_count untouched, trailing stops ratcheted up overnight on positive drift (XLE stop +$1.62 from May 13 placement to May 15 EOD on rising hwm). Visa-aware design held.
- **First-deployment week should weight entries toward leading-quadrant momentum, not defensive alternates.** Did this correctly (Energy/Industrials/Staples > Materials/Utilities).

### Adjustments for Next Week
- **Monday pre-market priority list:** XLB (only unheld leading-quadrant sector) → XLU (improving). Both in pre-market plan; re-validate live prices before market-open. Targets 5–6 position cap (Rule 2) and 75–85% deployment (Rule 5).
- **Watch XLI more carefully.** -1.34% after 2 sessions; if it crosses -7% (Rule 7) or sector rolls over (Rule 11), flag for midday hard-close. Industrials thesis is the weakest of the three and most exposed to tape rotation.
- **No strategy mutations proposed this week** (only 2 sessions of P&L data — too early). Continue rule book unchanged into Week 4.
- **Cadence guardrail:** EOD snapshot must be written every weekday (no May 8 / May 11 gaps). Daily-summary routine should not silently no-op on flat-equity days.

### Overall Grade: B+

Solid first deployment week. Beat the S&P, no rule violations, all stops placed per Rule 13, daytrade_count clean. Lost a half-grade for the May 12 stale-quote miss (cost ~one day of XLE/XLP exposure) and for sub-target deployment (58% vs 75–85%). Held book is green-or-flat with no Rule 7/8/10 triggers — clean baseline going into Week 4.
